    <h2 class="quote">My personal quote</h2>
    <p class="quotetext">For as long as we’ve got air in our lungs and beating hearts we’ve got to live on purpose and with purpose!</p>
    <h2>I describe myself as </h2> 
    <p> A creative problem solver with a mission to spread joy and energy! </p>
    <h2>My achievements</h2>
    <p> I have made positive contributions to the learning experience and wellbeing of my peers in my current roles as Course Representative for MA International Relations and Library Student Mentor. I have done this by driving three major improvements that will benefit current and future students. Firstly, I have successfully designed and delivered an Emotional Literacy workshop for my peers. Following this I initiated a workshop with the support of my Course Leader for all the Department of Social & Political Sciences postgraduate students on pursuing PhD study. Notably, I have contributed to the MA International Relations course by initiating a mentorship scheme that has been launched by the Course Leader, accessible to all students to be mentored across various projects in the Department of Social & Political Sciences. </p>
    <p> One of my favourite accomplishments is that I prior to my studies I successfully delivered a personal development program through which provided financial literacy coaching and public speaker training to students and professionals in various industries. I am on a mission to make the lives of other people better! </p>
    <h2>My skills include </h2>
    <p> Communication.  
        Analytical reasoning.  
        Adaptability.  
        Project management. 
        Relationship building.  
        Empathy.  </p>
    <h2>In my free time I like to</h2>
    <p> Go golfing, horse-riding and read articles on the Harvard Business Review and Psychology of Women journals. I have the cheesiest Sundays with long walks, gorgeous views, food that makes my heart go pop and a great book! I’m currently reading ‘Outspoken’ by Deborah Coughlin.  </p>
